            "jewelry-care": "<h2>Jewelry Care</h2><p>This is important! <p> Gold Plate: Our gold plated pieces are sterling silver heavily plated in 14k yellow gold. While the plating is strong, water and chemicals will affect plating over time and should be avoided. Perfumes, creams, lotions, and makeup all contain substances than can affect plated jewelry, so please remove jewelry before showering and keep away from products. If you would like to clean your plated piece, use a soft, damp cloth. Please be sure to fully dry your piece before wearing it and do not use harsh chemicals, jewelry cleaners or polishing cloths. To clean your jewelry, we recommend using a mild soap and water, and gently clean it with a soft bristled tooth brush. Immediately dry completely using a soft towel. It’s best to store your pieces in the (lovely) green TiuTiu pouch in which it came. </p><p>Sterling Silver: TiuTiu sterling silver pieces can be easily scratched if cleaned with harsh abrasive chemical cleansers. You can clean your sterling silver using products you have around your house! Make a paste with baking soda and water.  Coat your jewelry with this mixture and gently polish off, using lots of water. After any cleaning treatment, make sure to rinse and dry completely. Maintain the fresh sterling glow by using a jewelry polishing cloth, or a soft rag. It’s best to store your pieces in the (lovely) green TiuTiu pouch in which it came.</p>",
